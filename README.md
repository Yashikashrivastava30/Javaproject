# **Railways Management System – Java Project**

## **📌 Project Overview**

The **Railways Management System** is a Java-based application designed to simplify common railway operations such as managing trains, checking availability, handling reservations, and maintaining passenger records.

It aims to provide a structured, object-oriented solution for learning **Java, OOP principles, and basic console-based CRUD operations**.
The project can be used for academic purposes, mini-projects, or as a foundation for larger applications.

## **🧪 Instructions for Testing**

To test the system, follow these steps:

### **1. Launch the application**

When the program starts, you will see a **menu-driven interface**.

### **2. Test Train Operations**

* Add 2–3 trains
* View the train list
* Update a train
* Delete a train

### **3. Test Reservation Flow**

* Add a passenger
* Book a ticket
* Check if seat count reduces
* Cancel a reservation
* Confirm seat count updates

### **4. Test Search & View Operations**

* Search trains by number
* Search by route
* View all trains

### **5. Validate File Handling**

(If implemented)
Restart the app to check if previously stored data still appears.
