2. INTRODUCTION

The Railway Management System (RMS) is a Java-based project developed as
a part of the “Build Your Own Project” initiative under the Programming
in Java course. The project demonstrates the application of
Object-Oriented Programming concepts, modular system design, and
structured workflow implementation. The system focuses on digitizing
essential railway operations such as train management, passenger
handling, ticket booking, and reservation status tracking. The RMS aims
to provide a simplified, console-driven model of real-world railway
systems while illustrating key technical concepts taught in the course.

3. PROBLEM STATEMENT

Railway systems involve handling large amounts of information including
train schedules, passenger details, booking data, and seat availability.
Managing these processes manually is time-consuming and prone to human
error. The project aims to provide a structured digital solution that
automates these tasks. The system simplifies searching, booking,
updating, and maintaining railway data while ensuring accuracy,
efficiency, and ease of use.

4. FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

The Railway Management System includes the following major functional
modules:

1.  Train Management
    -   Add, update, view, and delete train records.
    -   Manage details such as train number, name, source, destination,
        and available seats.
2.  Passenger & Reservation Management
    -   Add passenger details.
    -   Book tickets with seat validation.
    -   Cancel reservations and update seat count automatically.
3.  Search & Availability
    -   Search trains by number or route.
    -   Check seat availability.
    -   Display complete train lists and passenger summaries.

Each module ensures a clear input/output structure and maintains a
logical flow for user interaction.

5. NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

The system adheres to several key non-functional requirements:

• Performance – All operations execute quickly and efficiently.
• Usability – Simple menu-driven interface ensures smooth user
interaction.
• Reliability – Booking and cancellation consistently update related
train and passenger data.
• Maintainability – Code is modular, well-structured, and easy to update
or extend.
• Error Handling – Handles invalid inputs, unavailable trains, and
incorrect passenger details gracefully.
• Scalability – New modules (e.g., payment, advanced search) can be
added without major rework.

6. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

The system architecture is designed around three key layers:

1.  User Interaction Layer – Command-line interface through which users
    perform operations.
2.  Application Logic Layer – Java classes and methods implementing
    functional requirements.
3.  Data Handling Layer – File-based or in-memory structures used to
    store train and passenger data.

The architecture emphasizes modularity, clear separation of concerns,
and reusable components.

7. DESIGN DIAGRAMS (DESCRIPTION)

• Use Case Diagram – Shows interactions between the user and major
system functions such as train management and booking.
• Workflow Diagram – Illustrates the sequence of menu selections and
operations.
• Sequence Diagram – Represents step-by-step execution flow for booking
or cancellation.
• Class Diagram – Displays classes like Train, Passenger, Reservation,
and their relationships.
• ER Diagram (if using storage) – Represents data entities and
attributes for trains and passengers.

8. DESIGN DECISIONS & RATIONALE

• Java was chosen due to its strong OOP support and modular structure.
• A console-based UI ensures simplicity and focus on core logic.
• Collections (ArrayList) allow flexible storage and fast searching.
• File handling (if added) enables data persistence across sessions.
• Input validation prevents incorrect entries and enhances user
experience.
• Modular class design allows future expansion, such as online payment
or seat preference logic.

9. IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

The implementation includes: • 5–10 Java classes/modules such as Train,
Passenger, RailwaySystem, ReservationManager, and Main.
• Proper folder structure separating data classes, service classes, and
utility modules.
• Meaningful comments and documentation explaining logic flow.
• Validation for inputs such as train number, seat count, and route
matching.
• Clean exception handling to avoid crashes during runtime.
• Git is used for version tracking and managing project updates.

10. SCREENSHOTS / RESULTS

Screenshots typically include: • Home menu screen
• Adding a new train
• Displaying trains
• Booking a ticket
• Viewing passenger list
• Cancellation confirmation
• Error messages for invalid inputs

(These will be added after running the program.)

11. TESTING APPROACH

The system was tested using the following approaches:

• Unit Testing – Each module (train addition, search, booking) was
tested individually.
• Input Validation Testing – Checked system behavior for invalid,
missing, or incorrect fields.
• Boundary Testing – Verified seat limits, edge cases, and repeated
booking/cancellation.
• Functional Testing – Ensured each menu option executed the correct
workflow.
• Manual Scenario Testing – Realistic booking scenarios were executed to
ensure consistency.

12. CHALLENGES FACED

• Designing a modular structure for multiple interconnected modules.
• Ensuring correct seat updates during both booking and cancellation.
• Handling invalid input gracefully without breaking program flow.
• Maintaining clarity in workflow and user prompts.
• Creating diagrams and aligning them with the architecture.

13. LEARNINGS & KEY TAKEAWAYS

• Improved understanding of Java OOP concepts and modular design.
• Learned how to structure console-based applications.
• Gained experience in designing workflows and data models.
• Strengthened knowledge of validation, error handling, and collection
usage.
• Understood importance of documentation and version control (Git).
• Developed confidence in developing real-world inspired systems.

14. FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS

Potential improvements include:

• Migration from console to GUI using JavaFX or Swing.
• Database integration using MySQL for persistent storage.
• Online payment simulation and fare calculation module.
• SMS/email confirmation for bookings (simulation).
• Advanced search filters like timings or train type.
• Admin panel with authentication.
